# Repository Overview

This repository contains supplementary information for our paper titled *"Discovering Octo-Bit-Based Formulas for Shape Descriptors, Simplexes, and Tetravoxels Using Selection-Based Regression"*. It aims to complement the paper and demonstrate the validity of our research findings.

## Included Files

### PDFs

- **`Structural.pdf`**: This document presents the structural and topological analysis of the 66 objects used in this research. It also details the algorithm used to extract the shape descriptors, Enclosing Surface and Volume.

- **`Tables_omp.pdf`**: This file includes LaTeX tables of formulas derived from the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) regression model. It showcases some of the most significant formulas obtained through this method, which was the most effective in our study.

- **`Tables_result.pdf`**: This document provides a comparison between state-of-the-art methods and our approach. It highlights that our method achieved 100% accuracy. It includes comparisons of 12 objects from Experiment 3 (out of the 66 voxelized objects) and 20 tumor samples from Experiment 4 using the BraTS 2020 dataset.

### CSV Files

Several folders contain CSV files with detailed data for each shape descriptor, simplexes, and tetravoxels. These files include:

- The formulas found for each descriptor.
- The size of each formula.
- The quantity of each descriptor.

Each folder corresponds to the regression model used.
